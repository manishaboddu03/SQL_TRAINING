SQL Data types;
--The data type of a column defines what value the column can hold: integer, character, money, date and time, binary, and so on.

---Each column in a database table is required to have a name and a data type
--Each column in a database table is required to have a name and a data type.

An SQL developer must decide what type of data that will be stored inside each column when creating a table. The data type is a guideline for SQL to understand what type of data is expected inside of each column, and it also identifies how SQL will interact with the stored data.

----Data types might have different names in different database. And even if the name is the same, the size and other details may be different! Always check the documentation

---In MySQL there are three main data types: string, numeric, and date and time.

--- BLOBs (Binary Large Objects).

-----All the numeric data types may have an extra option: UNSIGNED or ZEROFILL. If you add the UNSIGNED option, MySQL disallows negative values for the column. If you add the ZEROFILL option, MySQL automatically also adds the UNSIGNED attribute to the column.
